Spam Classification - Kernel Implementation (SVM algorithm). 

Many malicious web sites take advantage of us by sending a lot of useless emails. These spam emails contain unwanted content, such us spam-ads products, phishing sites or dangerous "drive-by" harness that infect a visitor's system with malware.

The given code try to classify whether an email is spam or it is not. I use the SVM Machine Learing algoritm (from the coursera course: "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng)

About Dataset:
I am using two email examples (emailSample1.txt and emailSample2.txt) and two spam examples
(spamSample1.txt and spamSample2.txt). All of them are download from the coursera course: "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng.
