# SVM-Kernel-implementation-for-Spam-Classification-
Spam Classification - Kernel Implementation (SVM algorithm). 

Many malicious web sites take advantage of us by sending a lot of useless emails. These spam emails contain unwanted content, such us spam-ads products, phishing sites or dangerous "drive-by" harness that infect a visitor's system with malware.

The given code try to classify whether an email is spam or it is not. I use the SVM Machine Learing algoritm (from the coursera course: "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng)

About Dataset:
I am using one email example (emailSample1.txt) and one spam examples (spamSample1.txt). All of them are download from the coursera course: "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Due to the Coursera: "Machine Learning" course policies I CAN´T upload the entire code of the following functions:
1. ProcessEmail.m
2. EmailFeatures.m
3. gaussianKernel.m

However, I do recommend you to try understand and complete the code by yourself.
